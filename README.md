# NextJS-NLP App
# &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;:technologist:

Just using this repo to share a link to my full-stack NLP web app: 

## &emsp;&emsp; **[Available Here](https://ai-helper-v1.vercel.app)** &emsp;&emsp; 

This project was built primarily using NextJS/FastAPI. 

The backend was deployed to the cloud using AWS&nbsp;Lambda/APIGateway/CDK.

Meanwhile, the frontend GUI is hosted using Vercel.
